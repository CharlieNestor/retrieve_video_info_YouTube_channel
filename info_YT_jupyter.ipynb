We start by setting up LLMs using both closed-source (OpenAI API) and open-source (Llama 2 via Ollama) options. Next, we walk through how we can leverage the LLMs to parse out entities from text. After this we actually start playing around with our data, loading in a specific subcategory of documents from Kaggle and see how we can connect pages from the same documents together. Once this is completed, we repeat the entity parsing process for our actual data to get pieces of information such as names, ages, and locations from our documents. Finally we analyze these entities to learn some insights from our document database.\\n\\nKaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keithgalli/freedmens-bureau-historical-documents\\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/keithgalli/historical-docs-analysis  \\nProject Website: https://freedmensbureau.info \\n\\nContributors:\\nAbdessalem Boukil (NLP Research & Analysis): https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdessalem-boukil-37923637/\\nTrent Self (Kaggle Dataset Setup): https://www.linkedin.com/in/trentonself/\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this project video, make sure to throw it a thumbs up & subscribe!

This feature allows you to visualize and interact with your API directly at http://localhost:5000/apidocs, offering a clear and user-friendly overview of your API's capabilities.\\n\\nAdditionally, we cover essential practices like working with GitHub repositories, managing Python libraries, and employing Flask and Flask-Restful for API development. The skills in crafting effective GET and POST requests are emphasized, highlighting the importance of efficient system communication.\\n\\nThis video is ideal for anyone keen on enhancing their Python programming, API development, and cloud deployment skills. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this tutorial provides valuable experience in developing well-documented and user-friendly APIs.\\n\\nVideo timeline!\\n0:00 - Video overview\\n1:18 - What we're building\\n3:20 - How to get setup with Github template code\\n7:00 - Taking a look at the Flask, Flasgger Python3 code\\n8:38 - Testing some API requests (GET) locally\\n13:09 - Building another GET request endpoint (with multiple parameters)\\n14:34 - Using ChatGPT to help us build another endpoint\\n22:43 - Deploying our API to a live public URL endpoint (using render.com)\\n\\n-------------------------\\nFollow me on social media!\\nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/keithgalli/\\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/keithgalli\\nTikTok | https://tiktok.com/@keithgalli\\n\\n-------------------------\\nIf you are curious to learn how I make my tutorials, check out this video: https://youtu.be/LEO4igyXbLs\\n\\nPractice your Python Pandas data science skills with problems on StrataScratch!\\nhttps://stratascratch.com/?via=keith\\n\\nJoin the Python Army to get access to perks!\\nYouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq6XkhO5SZ66N04IcPbqNcw/join\\nPatreon - https://www.patreon.com/keithgalli\\n\\n*I use affiliate links on the products that I recommend.

Many of these tips have helped me become more efficient writing Python code for my data science projects. \\n\\nTopics covered:\\n- Running bash commands from a jupyter notebook. You can use ‚Äú!‚Äù in a code cell to run any terminal command that you want. You can also try using the ‚Äú%‚Äù to execute magic lines. This includes some of the same bash commands that you might gravitate to as well as some Jupyter specific commands.\\n- The most useful shortcuts that I think you should know. Ctrl+enter to run a cell, shift+enter to run a cell and skip to the next, B to create new cells below, M to turn a cell to markdown, and several more. We will also look at find & replace in this section.\\n- Changing pandas default display settings (number of rows to display, columns, decimal points, etc.)\\n- Turning on OS alerts for running Jupyter Notebook cells. This is particularly useful if you have a long machine learning model training job going on and you want to know exactly when it finishes so that you can play around with the results.\\n- Creating slideshows within a Jupyter notebook! \\n\\nBonus topic:\\n- Changing your Jupyter Notebook theme! Monokai is a good one to use if you like dark-themes\\n\\nSource code:\\nhttps://github.com/KeithGalli/Data-Science-Tips/tree/master/jupyter-notebook-tips\\n\\nIf you have any questions about these tips & tricks, or if you have additional recommendations, please let me know in the comments!\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed this video!

       "  'description': \"Practice your Python Pandas data science skills with problems on StrataScratch!\\nhttps://stratascratch.com/?via=keith\\n\\nIn this video we work on a real world computer vision problem using Python. The problem task is to create a model that can distinguish a flower known as ‚ÄúLa Eterna‚Äù from other types of flowers.\\n\\nTo do this we create convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the Tensorflow/Keras libraries. We examine how to create a simple model and then improve it using techniques such as data augmentation & preprocessing. We play around with different types of network architectures and see how changes improve or decrease overall task performance.\\n\\nLink to source code (Github):\\nhttps://github.com/KeithGalli/Unlocked_Challenge_4 \\n\\nLink to HP challenge:\\nhttps://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/industries/data-science/unlocked-challenge.html \\n\\nMy previous videos on neural networks!\\nIntro to neural nets: https://youtu.be/aBIGJeHRZLQ\\nReal-world tutorial: https://youtu.be/44U8jJxaNp8 \\n\\n*** I've left a bunch of additional useful resources in the README of the Github repo ***\\n\\nVideography for clips I integrated at the start by Ryan Cabana\\nhttps://www.ryancabana.com/\\n\\nHopefully you enjoy this video!

We start with a brief introduction to HTML & CSS and discuss what web scraping is. Next we start getting into the basics of the beautiful soup library. This includes how to load a webpage, the basic commands you need to know such as find & find_all, grabbing strings from an HTML elements, etc. The final section of this tutorial is a series of exercises where you can practice your skills.

We look at why we use neural networks and how they function. We do an overview of network architecture (input layer, hidden layers, output layer). We talk a bit about how you choose how many hidden layers and neurons to have. We also look at hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, optimizers (adam), activation functions (relu, sigmoid, softmax), and dropout. We finish the first section of the video talking a little about the differences between keras, tensorflow, & pytorch.\\n\\nNext, we jump into some coding examples to classify data with neural nets. In this section we load in data, do some processing, build our network, fit our data to it, and then finally evaluate our model. The examples get more complex as we go along. Some setup instructions for the coding portion of the video are found below.\\n\\nTo install Tensorflow, download Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/\\nData & code used in tutorial: https://github.com/KeithGalli/neural-nets\\n\\nI‚Äôm going to post a follow up video to this soon where we walk through a real world example where we automatically classify images of hands for the game of rock, paper, scissors. Hopefully that should be up about 2 weeks from now. (EDIT: part 2 has been posted, link below)\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to like & subscribe.

Tasks during this section include:\\n- Drop NaN values from DataFrame\\n- Removing rows based on a condition\\n- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)\\n\\nOnce we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:\\n- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?\\n- What city sold the most product?\\n- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customer‚Äôs buying product?\\n- What products are most often sold together?\\n- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?\\n\\nTo answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:\\n- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)\\n- Adding columns\\n- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)\\n- Using the .apply() method\\n- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis\\n- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results\\n- Labeling our graphs\\n\\nIf you enjoy this video, make sure to leave it a like and subscribe to not miss any future similar tutorials :).\\n\\nCheck out the new \"solving real world data science tasks\" video I posted!\\nhttps://youtu.be/Ewgy-G9cmbg\\n\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nFollow me on social media!\\nInstagram | https://www.instagram.com/keithgalli/\\nTwitter | https://twitter.com/keithgalli\\n\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nVideo Timeline!\\n0:00 - Intro\\n1:22 - Downloading the Data\\n2:57 - Getting started with the code (Jupyter Notebook)\\n\\nTask #1: Merging 12 csvs into a single dataframe (3:35)\\n4:25 - Read single CSV file\\n5:44 - List all files in a directory \\n7:06 - Concatenating files\\n11:00 - Reading in Updated dataframe\\n\\nTask #2: Add a Month column (12:48)\\n14:12 - Parse string in Pandas cell (.str)\\n\\nCleaning our data!\\n17:31 - Drop NaN values from df\\n21:25 - Remove rows based on condition\\n\\nTask #3: Add a sales column (24:58)\\n25:58 - Another way to convert a column to numeric (ints & floats)\\n\\nQuestion #1: What was the best month for sales?

Hopefully this video will help you get comfortable working through the matplotlib library. I'm going to post a follow up video with real-world examples (combining pandas with matplotlib) and different types of plots next week. I originally was going to include that in this one, but I thought the video was getting a bit too long.\\n\\nIn this video we walk through some of the basics of matplotlib. We start by making a simple line graph. We learn how to give the graph a title and label the x & y axis. We learn how to scale the graph by specifying the x & y tickmarks. After this, we restyle our line by passing in keyword arguments then do basically the same thing with a shorthand notation. We resize our graph and save it. Then we end with a simple bar chart. \\n\\nSource Code (includes code and data for next video as well):\\nhttps://github.com/KeithGalli/matplotlib_tutorial/\\n\\nMatplotlib Pyplot Documentation:\\nhttps://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html\\n\\nFont List:\\nhttp://jonathansoma.com/lede/data-studio/matplotlib/list-all-fonts-available-in-matplotlib-plus-samples/\\n\\nInstall libraries Needed for this video:\\nOption 1:\\nOpen up a terminal window and type\\npip install matplotlib\\npip install numpy\\npip install pandas\\n\\nOption 2:\\nDownload anaconda which will contain all the packages we need.

We start off by installing pandas and loading in an example csv. We then look at different ways to read the data. Read a column, rows, specific cell, etc. Also ways to read data based on conditioning. We then move into some more advanced ways to sort & filter data. We look at making conditional changes to our data. We also start doing aggregate stats using the groupby function. We finished the video talking about how you would work with a very large dataset (many gigabytes)\\n\\nI realized as I upload this video there are some additional things I want to talk about in a later video.
