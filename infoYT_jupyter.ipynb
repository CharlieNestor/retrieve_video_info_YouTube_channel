Changepoint models allow us to know when changes happen in these data and what they look like. Probabilistic modelling allows us to elegantly build customizable changepoint models for different data types, as well as provide us with uncertainty estimates for the position and magnitude of the change (both indispensable quantities for decision-making and hypothesis testing). This tutorial will briefly cover building changepoint models for multivariate data using PyMC but will primarily focus on the ways in which this “basic” model can be extended.\\n\\nThis tutorial is targeted towards academic researchers, data scientists, and anyone interested in being able to easily build bespoke models which provide uncertainty estimates for inferred statistics. This talk will attempt to be accessible to beginners but leans towards more intermediate users interested in changepoint modelling. Previous experience with PyMC, and a background in statistical modelling is assumed. No libraries other than PyMC and the basic scientific stack (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) will be used.\\n\\nThe tutorial aims to be hands-on, will discuss some theory to provide context for the models discussed, and will be heavy on understanding code to construct the “guts” of the models (in particular, selection of distributions for modelling the emissions and changepoint locations, and the details of the tensor manipulation to put everything together).\\nThe tutorial will be divided into three parts:\\n\\nIntroduction to changepoint modelling and use cases.\\nConstruction of the “basic” multivariate changepoint model.\\nExtensions to the “basic” model:\\n- Handling drift/noise in repeated observations using mixture emissions across multiple timeseries observations.\\n- Determining the distribution over number of changepoints using a Dirichlet Process prior.\\n\\nContent:\\n🎥 Abuzar's Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySF3X45XRyQ\\n🎥 Walkthrough of changepoint modelling in PyMC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwNju1o5yQo\\n📝 Code Notebook: https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/pymcon_bayesian_changepoint/blob/72102ad6149b86d586595bf4523f40f66eb20c25/Bayesian_Changepoint_Zoo_neural_data.ipynb\\n👉 Discourse Post for more details and discussion: https://discourse.pymc.io/t/13251\\n\\n\\n📢 PyMCon is a community conference that shares the latest in statistical practices, tricks, and tips.

With it, we can automatically derive and evaluate probability expressions from user-specified random functions. Similar to automatic differentiation, this allows users to create rich generative models and exploit probability-based algorithms (e.g., NUTS) without having to manually implement their own probability functions.\\n\\nIn this talk, we present this new foundation of PyMC and how it can (and is already) used to construct specialized classes of models, from arbitrary variable transformations to mixture distributions, censoring processes, and highly structured timeseries.\\n\\nThe goal is to understand what makes PyMC a true probabilistic programming language and how you can exploit it!\\n\\n🔗 You can see more details on the Discourse post: https://discourse.pymc.io/t/12274\\n🔗 Register now for the upcoming Q&A session: https://www.meetup.com/pymc-online-meetup/events/294021273\\n\\n📢 PyMCon is a community conference that shares the latest in statistical practices, tricks, and tips.

In practice, for all but the smallest data sets, one needs to resort to approximations to actually fit GPs in any reasonable amount of time. There are currently a few GP approximations implemented in PyMC based on inducing points that are fast, but only apply when the likelihood is Gaussian. The Hilbert Space Gaussian Process (HSGP) approximation works well with any likelihood and scales as O(nm + m). In this talk I’ll introduce a PyMC HSGP implementation and show via case studies how it fills a few key gaps in the PyMC GP library: fast GPs as model subcomponents, and fast GPs with non-Gaussian likelihoods. I’ll also cover tips and tricks for applying HSGPs effectively in practice.\\n\\nFor the full details see the PyMC Discourse:\\n\\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/pymcon-web-series-03a-introduction-to-hilbert-space-gps-hsgps-in-pymc-mar-15-2023-bill-engels/11533', 'duration': 'PT1H3M19S', 'tags': None, 'timestamps': None}, 'WVr2vQ13WAk': {'title': 'PyMCon Web Series - Scalable Bayesian Modeling - Sandra Yojana Meneses', 'published_at': '2023-04-09T01:17:06Z', 'description': 'To learn about upcoming events check out the website: https://pymcon.com/events/\\n\\nPyMC has now multiple options to boost its performance (JAX support, training on GPUs, etc).

Sandra wrote a detailed blog post in which she presented a benchmarking template, demonstrating that PyMC can work with large datasets and illustrating different approaches to doing so. The benchmarking template itself was published as reproducible code so that the performance of future version of PyMC and/or other libraries can be tested.

He will take a cursory look at the Aesara backend, focusing on the brand new RandomVariable operators, which are the foundation of PyMC models. He will then talk about a self-contained PPL project (Aeppl) dedicated to converting Aesara RandomVariable graphs to probability functions. Finally, he will clarify how PyMC makes use of these two packages to create efficient random generator functions and probability evaluation functions, with the ultimate goal of facilitating a fully-fledged modern Bayesian workflow.\\n\\nAesara is a Python library that allows users to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Aesara is based on Theano (https://github.com/Theano/Theano), which has been powering large-scale computationally intensive scientific investigations since 2007.\\n\\nAeppl is a new library focused on converting (arbitrary) graphs containing Aesara RandomVariables into joint log-probability graphs. It can understand complex graphs that include nested operations, conditionals, loops, and advanced indexing, allowing one to generate rich probability functions automatically without having to muddle through the mathematical details.\\n\\n## About the speaker\\nRicardo Vieira is a PyMC developer and data scientist at PyMC Labs.

Now comes the data, but wait: the units don’t match! And to make matters worse, the correlation between model variable and measurement readout is non-linear and heteroscedastic! Sounds familiar? non-linear calibration to the rescue! With calibr8, we present a statistical framework and corresponding open source Python package that solves non-linear calibration and likelihood functions for modeling. From a laboratory automation and systems biology perspective, the advantage of non-linear calibration with calibr8 is two-fold: For lab scientists doing (high-throughput) experiments, calibr8 facilitates more intuitive uncertainty quantification and makes every-day data analysis more robust, automatable and Bayesian. From a modeling perspective, non-linear error models are essential components of realistic Bayesian process models, and are key to accurately describe the nastiest step of the data-generating process. In this talk, we will take you step-by-step through the data-generating process of an automated bioassay and demonstrate how its non-linearities are modeled with calibr8. We will show how calibr8 can make your life easier - and of course more Bayesian - even if you don’t always go all the way to a process model. Finally, we will show how non-linear error models and multi-level modeling with PyMC enable you to get more information out of heterogeneous regression analyses. Join us for the talk and discussion to learn about building Bayesian models for bioassays and dive into the fascinatingly frightening world of non-linear measurement errors!\\n\\n\\nDiscourse Discussion\\nhttps://discourse.pymc.io/t/calibr8-going-beyond-linear-ranges-with-non-linear-calibration-curves-and-multilevel-modeling-by-michael-osthege-laura-helleckes/6025\\n\\n\\n## Timestamps\\n00:00 Introduction\\n00:41 Biotechnology\\n01:43 Example\\n03:26 Process Model\\n06:03 Multilevel Modeling\\n07:26 Error Models\\n09:10 Error Model Implementation\\n12:45 Application Example\\n15:17 Code\\n18:39 Summary\\n\\nSpeaker info: \\nA biotechnologist by training, Laura transitioned to Data Science in the past years and is now a Bayesian enthusiast.\\nIn her Master’s thesis, she actually collected the data Michael was using for his fancy Bayesian models.

This kind of sampling is called posterior predictive sampling, and it can be very hard. The typical problems that show up are related to shape mismatches in hierarchical models, latent categorical values that aren’t correctly re-sampled or changing the shape of the data between the training and test phases.
