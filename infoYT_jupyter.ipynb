Just enter your bash curl request in the input above and look at the magic.\\n\\nSay you need to test that an endpoint of your API is working. Just curl it in your terminal and see the results.

We start by setting up LLMs using both closed-source (OpenAI API) and open-source (Llama 2 via Ollama) options. Next, we walk through how we can leverage the LLMs to parse out entities from text. After this we actually start playing around with our data, loading in a specific subcategory of documents from Kaggle and see how we can connect pages from the same documents together. Once this is completed, we repeat the entity parsing process for our actual data to get pieces of information such as names, ages, and locations from our documents. Finally we analyze these entities to learn some insights from our document database.\\n\\nKaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keithgalli/freedmens-bureau-historical-documents\\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/keithgalli/historical-docs-analysis  \\nProject Website: https://freedmensbureau.info \\n\\nContributors:\\nAbdessalem Boukil (NLP Research & Analysis): https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdessalem-boukil-37923637/\\nTrent Self (Kaggle Dataset Setup): https://www.linkedin.com/in/trentonself/\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this project video, make sure to throw it a thumbs up & subscribe!

This part is crucial for understanding the core functions of APIs and making them accessible worldwide.\\n\\nIn the second video, we progress to implementing POST requests and constructing a full-fledged Book Review API, similar to services like Goodreads. This involves integrating API functionality to post and retrieve book reviews from a database, with practical examples using Airtable for database interaction.\\n\\nFlasgger plays a crucial role in our tutorial, providing interactive documentation through its SwaggerUI integration. This feature allows you to visualize and interact with your API directly at http://localhost:5000/apidocs, offering a clear and user-friendly overview of your API's capabilities.\\n\\nAdditionally, we cover essential practices like working with GitHub repositories, managing Python libraries, and employing Flask and Flask-Restful for API development. The skills in crafting effective GET and POST requests are emphasized, highlighting the importance of efficient system communication.\\n\\nThis video is ideal for anyone keen on enhancing their Python programming, API development, and cloud deployment skills.

Many of these tips have helped me become more efficient writing Python code for my data science projects. \\n\\nTopics covered:\\n- Running bash commands from a jupyter notebook. You can use ‚Äú!‚Äù in a code cell to run any terminal command that you want. You can also try using the ‚Äú%‚Äù to execute magic lines. This includes some of the same bash commands that you might gravitate to as well as some Jupyter specific commands.\\n- The most useful shortcuts that I think you should know. Ctrl+enter to run a cell, shift+enter to run a cell and skip to the next, B to create new cells below, M to turn a cell to markdown, and several more. We will also look at find & replace in this section.\\n- Changing pandas default display settings (number of rows to display, columns, decimal points, etc.)\\n- Turning on OS alerts for running Jupyter Notebook cells. This is particularly useful if you have a long machine learning model training job going on and you want to know exactly when it finishes so that you can play around with the results.\\n- Creating slideshows within a Jupyter notebook! \\n\\nBonus topic:\\n- Changing your Jupyter Notebook theme! Monokai is a good one to use if you like dark-themes\\n\\nSource code:\\nhttps://github.com/KeithGalli/Data-Science-Tips/tree/master/jupyter-notebook-tips\\n\\nIf you have any questions about these tips & tricks, or if you have additional recommendations, please let me know in the comments!\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed this video!

The problem task is to create a model that can distinguish a flower known as ‚ÄúLa Eterna‚Äù from other types of flowers.\\n\\nTo do this we create convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the Tensorflow/Keras libraries. We examine how to create a simple model and then improve it using techniques such as data augmentation & preprocessing.

We look at why we use neural networks and how they function. We do an overview of network architecture (input layer, hidden layers, output layer). We talk a bit about how you choose how many hidden layers and neurons to have. We also look at hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, optimizers (adam), activation functions (relu, sigmoid, softmax), and dropout. We finish the first section of the video talking a little about the differences between keras, tensorflow, & pytorch.\\n\\nNext, we jump into some coding examples to classify data with neural nets. In this section we load in data, do some processing, build our network, fit our data to it, and then finally evaluate our model. The examples get more complex as we go along. Some setup instructions for the coding portion of the video are found below.\\n\\nTo install Tensorflow, download Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/\\nData & code used in tutorial: https://github.com/KeithGalli/neural-nets\\n\\nI‚Äôm going to post a follow up video to this soon where we walk through a real world example where we automatically classify images of hands for the game of rock, paper, scissors. Hopefully that should be up about 2 weeks from now. (EDIT: part 2 has been posted, link below)\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to like & subscribe.

To do this we abstract out similar parts of the code into their own classes & files. Once the new code is written, we go through some examples of how we can extend its functionality in fun ways. We make a couple more difficult levels of the game which is made very easy by the new code architecture. The final product is a lot more similar to code you would write as a full time software developer at a company like Google, Facebook, etc‚Ä¶\\n\\nAs always I left a video timeline in the comments!

Hopefully this video will help you get comfortable working through the matplotlib library. I'm going to post a follow up video with real-world examples (combining pandas with matplotlib) and different types of plots next week. I originally was going to include that in this one, but I thought the video was getting a bit too long.\\n\\nIn this video we walk through some of the basics of matplotlib. We start by making a simple line graph. We learn how to give the graph a title and label the x & y axis. We learn how to scale the graph by specifying the x & y tickmarks. After this, we restyle our line by passing in keyword arguments then do basically the same thing with a shorthand notation. We resize our graph and save it. Then we end with a simple bar chart. \\n\\nSource Code (includes code and data for next video as well):\\nhttps://github.com/KeithGalli/matplotlib_tutorial/\\n\\nMatplotlib Pyplot Documentation:\\nhttps://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html\\n\\nFont List:\\nhttp://jonathansoma.com/lede/data-studio/matplotlib/list-all-fonts-available-in-matplotlib-plus-samples/\\n\\nInstall libraries Needed for this video:\\nOption 1:\\nOpen up a terminal window and type\\npip install matplotlib\\npip install numpy\\npip install pandas\\n\\nOption 2:\\nDownload anaconda which will contain all the packages we need.

We start off by installing pandas and loading in an example csv. We then look at different ways to read the data. Read a column, rows, specific cell, etc. Also ways to read data based on conditioning. We then move into some more advanced ways to sort & filter data. We look at making conditional changes to our data. We also start doing aggregate stats using the groupby function. We finished the video talking about how you would work with a very large dataset (many gigabytes)\\n\\nI realized as I upload this video there are some additional things I want to talk about in a later video. The first thing that comes to mind immediately is using the apply() function on a dataframe to alter the data using a custom or lambda function. If you have questions on this or anything else before I get around to making  a part 2, feel free to write me a note in the comments.\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this video, be sure to throw it a like and make sure to subscribe to not miss any future videos!\\n\\nThanks for watching friends!
